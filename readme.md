# ü™Ñ Speech recognition program for Raspberry Pi or PC in Python

## ‚ú® To configure Raspberry:
1. Install manjaro arm minimal and do some basic config
2. Install git (`pacman -Sy git --noconfirm`)
3. Clone this repo (`git clone https://github.com/Bicycle-LEDs/RPi-firmware`)
4. Run `sh RPi-firmware/config/system-setup.sh` 

‚ö†Ô∏è This will move your manjaro branch to *testing*, install yay, install stuff required to run this project

## ‚ö° To run this project:
1. Clone this repo (`git clone https://github.com/Bicycle-LEDs/RPi-firmware`) *make sure you have **git** installed*
2. Make sure you have `portaudio` (or `libportaudio19-dev`) installed (**for linux only**)
3. Install requirements (skip this step if used Raspberry configurator) (`sh RPi-firmware/config/meet-requirements.sh`)
4. Create `credentials.json` file inside `app` folder from example - you need to obtain your chatgpt api key from their "for developers" page and obtain JSON cookies from bing.com for account with chat access using CookieEditor browser extension
5. Run script: ```python launch.py```, to skip updating use ```python launch.py *whatever*```
